1. Find the project in the `projects` array
2. Update the `media` array:

```typescript
media: [
  {
    type: 'image', // can be 'image', 'video', or 'gif'
    url: '/path/to/image.jpg',
    caption: 'Caption for this image'
  },
  // Add more media items...
]
```

### Project Details

The project detail popup displays comprehensive information. Additional fields that can be customized:

```typescript
{
  // Add these optional fields for more detailed information
  fullDescription: "A more detailed description of the project that will appear in the details popup...",
  contribution: "My specific contribution to this project included architecture design, frontend development...",
  links: [
    { text: "GitHub Repository", url: "https://github.com/username/repo" },
    { text: "Documentation", url: "https://docs.project.com" }
  ],
  timeline: {
    duration: "6 months",
    completed: "December 2023"
  }
}
```

## Common Tips

1. **Images**:
   - For project cards: use high-quality images with good contrast
   - For path section: no specific images required, but you can customize icons
   - Image URLs can be external (https://...) or local (/images/...)

2. **Text Content**:
   - Keep descriptions concise for cards
   - Use more detailed descriptions in popups/expanded views
   - Use metrics to highlight quantifiable achievements

3. **Technical Tips**:
   - Always include comma after each array item and property
   - Maintain proper TypeScript syntax
   - Test the site after making changes to ensure everything displays correctly

4. **Updating Categories/Filter Tags**:
   - Add new categories to your projects' `categories` arrays
   - They will automatically appear in the filter section

5. **Icons**:
   - The site uses Lucide icons for most UI elements
   - For projects, you must use one of the predefined icons: "chart", "rocket", or "game"
   - For adding new icon types, you would need to update the `icons` object in Projects.tsx
